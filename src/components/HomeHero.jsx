                        <p>A total of 5 billion people around the world use the internet today â€“ equivalent to 63 percent of the world's total population.<br /><br />As the number of users increases, more ideas and opportunities enter the internet world. Being a computer science graduate, I am always curious about technological innovations and the benefits we get from them. I identify myself as a beginner in the information and technology field having sound knowledge of website design, website development, and client interaction. I like to engage myself in problems that will eventually get solved and teach me something new.<br /><br />I work as a Full-time website developer and in my leisure time, I freelance on multiple platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. I am a 5-star rated Fiverr seller and expect to achieve a Level One seller badge.<br /><br />You can visit my LinkedIn profile.
